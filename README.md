## Data Source

The source of the data is the official website of the [Moroccan Ministry](http://www.habous.gov.ma/), the code
behind the scrapping process in available in [this github repo](https://github.com/Kafiil/habous-scraper), the result is saved to a json file and then imported to a monogo database.
